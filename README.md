# Shifted-Letters-Numbers

The purpose of this assignment was to shift the letters in the alphabet forward one so that when the user types on the keyboard, 
the letter they pressed will enter the letter after it to the screen:

a -> b

b -> c

c -> d

d -> e

e -> f

f -> g

g -> h

h -> i

i -> j

j -> k

k -> l 

l -> m

m -> n

n -> o

o -> p

p -> q

q -> r

r -> s

s -> t

t -> u

u -> v

v -> w

w -> x

x -> y

y -> z

z -> a

(and same for the upper case letters)
The numbers on should be flipped so that their output should be as shown:

0 -> 9

1 -> 8

2 -> 7

3 -> 6

4 -> 5

5 -> 4

6 -> 3

7 -> 2

8 -> 1

9 -> 0
